### Welcome to the `Road to Hacker` website.
##### The website is a work in progress, and will host my study notes on my journey to becoming an ethical hacker.

I'm self-taught, and not a college student, therefore I might get some things wrong.\
If so, please open an issue, and I'll make sure to take a look at it and update as soon as possible.\
Feel free to open issues if you catch any `markdown` syntax problems, or spellings errors.

Special thanks to my good friend `Erty` for all the help with the rabbit-hole that is `git`.
