# road2hacker

This repo is a work in progress, and will host my study notes on my journey to becoming an ethical hacker.

I'm self-taught, and not a college student, therefore I might get some things wrong.\
If so, please open an issue, and I'll make sure to take a look at it and update as soon as possible.\
Feel free to open issues if you catch any `markdown` syntax problems, or spellings errors.\
