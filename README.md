# road2hacker

This repo will host my study notes on my journey to becoming an ethical hacker.

I'm not a college student and don't have a mentor, therefore I might get some things wrong.  
If so, please report an issue and I'll make sure to take a look at it and update as soon as possible.  
Feel free to open issues if you catch any markdown syntax problems or spellings.
