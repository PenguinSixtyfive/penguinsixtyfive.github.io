My name is `Penguin`, I found a love for Cyber Security and Penetration Testing a few years back, and the rest is history.

I'm self-taught, and not a college student, so I might get some things wrong.\
If you catch anything incorrect, `markdown` or spelling issues, please open an issue in my repo, and I'll make sure to fix it as soon as possible.

Special thanks to my good friend `Erty` for all the help with the rabbit-hole that is `git`.
