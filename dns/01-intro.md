# Intro

`DNS` is short for `Domain Name System`.  
It is used to resolve (change) website URLs to IP addresses.  
It runs on port 53, and it can run on both UDP and TCP depending on payload size.  

### Domain hierarchy

DNS is setup like a tree, it starts at root servers, and branches out.  
There are 13 root server clusters around the world.  

1. First branch is called Top Level Domains (TLDs).  
TLDs include but are not limited to: .com, .net, .uk, .se ... etc.  
2. Second level domains represent things like the domain name: google, microsoft... etc.  
3. Third level domains are branches of the website, they could be a server or a record: www, mail, images... etc.  
DNS can have an unlimited amounts of domain levels.  

### Examples:  
`wiki.debian.org`  
`mail.google.com`
